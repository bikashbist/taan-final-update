                        Trekking Agencies' Association of Nepal (TAAN) is an umbrella association of trekking
                        agencies in the country. It was established in 1979 by a handful of trekking agency
                        operators who felt it was time to devise sound business principles as well as regulate
                        the
                        sector which was growing by leaps and bounds with every passing year. They also felt the
                        need of a strong lobby group that could suggest to the government on several issues to
                        promote the Nepali tourism industry and develop tourism as a revenue generating
                        industry.
